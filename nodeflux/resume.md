Summary
-------
Web application development in python and javascript are my primary interests. I have extensive experience developing and scaling websites using technologies and platforms like Django, AJAX and AWS, along with various data backends. From a systems standpoint, I've used Linux heavily and have developed deployment and continuous integration systems utilizing Chef and fabric. As for data, I firmly believe how data needs to be accessed should dictate how it should be stored.

I learn new concepts and systems quickly and am receptive to new ideas. I work well alone or in a team and also have experience managing teams.
